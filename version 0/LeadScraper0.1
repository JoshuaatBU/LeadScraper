The other eight brands do not contain enough lead to increase the blood lead level above the threshold level for lead poisoning, assuming a typical scenario of a child chewing on small pieces of lead- containing crayons over a span of time. However, CPSC is very concerned about these crayons because they add to the overall \"lead load\" to children who may eat them. If a child ate an entire lead-containing crayon over the same span of time, the lead poisoning threshold for these crayons would be exceeded.

Firm will recall from the \"Only Deals\" chain. - \"Feido, 12 Crayons, No. CC8812,\" Kipp Brothers Inc., Indianapolis, IN. Sold 19,006 nationwide. Firm will destroy 3,438 boxes of crayons left in inventory. All of these crayons contain lead. The first three (Concord, Toys \"R\" Us, and Glory) contain enough lead to present a lead poisoning hazard to young children who might eat or chew on the crayons. The other eight brands do not contain enough lead to increase the blood lead level above the threshold level for lead poisoning (10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and supported by other Federal agencies). This assumes a typical scenario of a child chewing on small pieces of lead-containing crayons over a span of time. However, CPSC is very concerned about these crayons because they add to the overall \"lead load\" to children who eat them. If a child ate an entire lead- containing crayon over the same span of time, the lead poisoning threshold for these crayons would be exceeded. The CPSC staff found the lead-containing crayons during a nationwide survey of crayons imported from China. In a separate action, the Arizona Department of Health Services had previously found some crayons imported from China to be a source of high blood lead levels in a Phoenix infant. The Los Angeles-based importer of those crayons, Concord Enterprises, recalled those crayons in cooperation with CPSC on March 22, 1994. Toys \"R\" Us conducted tests at an independent lab and did not find hazardous amounts of lead in the crayons they tested. Nevertheless, Toys \"R\" Us and CPSC urge consumers to take the Toys \"R\" Us crayons away from children and discard them or return them to a Toys \"R\" Us store for a refund. Parents should buy only crayons and other children\\'s art materials that have this label: \"Conforms to ASTM D-4236,\" or similar words. This label means that the formulas of the crayons and other art materials have been reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and are labeled appropriately. In the case of the crayons imported by Glory Stationery Manufacturing Company Limited, it was inappropriate for the crayons to be labeled \"Conforms to ASTM D-4236\" because the crayons contained hazardous levels of lead. CPSC will continue to test art materials to assure that the ASTM label is being properly used. CPSC also will continue to work with the U.S. Customs Service to seize non- ASTM-labeled crayons at ports of entry. Parents should not buy old non-ASTM-labeled art materials still on store shelves. CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said, \"While there are other causes of lead poisoning, such as lead paint, no children\\'s product, especially crayons, should contain lead. Throw these crayons in the trash or take them back to the store for a refund.\" Lead has long been recognized asa hazardous substance, especially to young children, infants, and fetuses. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible brain damage and can impair mental functioning. It can retard mental and physical development and reduce attention span. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) bans children\\'s products containing hazardous amounts of lead. In addition, the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA) amendments to the FHSA require that all art materials be reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and be labeled appropriately. Crayons that contain hazardous lead levels are banned hazardous substances and crayons without the conformance label are misbranded art materials under the law. CPSC\\'s mission is to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission\\'s objective is to reduce the estimated 28.6 million injuries and 21,700 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC\\'s jurisdiction', 'URL': 'https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1994/CPSC-Announces-Recalls-Of-Imported-Crayons-Because-Of-Lead-Poisoning-Hazard', 'Title': 'CPSC Announces Recalls Of Imported Crayons Because Of Lead Poisoning Hazard', 'ConsumerContact': None, 'LastPublishDate': '2015-02-13T00:00:00', 'Products': [{'Name': 'Baum Crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Cohen School Quality Crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Concord Enterprises Jumbo Crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': 'Crayons & Chalk', 'CategoryID': '1901', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Crayons That Paint', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Dynamic Crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Dynamic Super Jumbo Crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Feido Crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Fun Time Crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Glory Crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': \"I'm a Toys R Us Kid!

WASHINGTON, DC -- CPSC and Concord Enterprises announces the recall of certain crayons imported from China because of a lead poisoning hazard. CPSC tested the crayons and found hazardous amounts of lead in the yellow and orange color crayons. If a child eats or chews on the crayon, lead poisoning could occur. Therefore, CPSC urges consumers to take the crayons away from children and discard them or return them to the store for a refund. Retailers should stop sale and return the crayons to Concord Enterprises. Parents should buy only crayons and other children\\'s art materials that have this label: \"Conforms to ASTM D-4236,\" or similar words. This label means that the crayons and other art materials have been reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and are labeled appropriately. No art materials lacking the conformance label or bearing hazard labeling should be given to young children.CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said, \"While there are other major causes of lead poisoning, such as lead paint, we want to eliminate any additional lead sources, such as crayons. Throw these crayons in the trash can or take them back to the store for a refund.\" Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous substance, especially to young children, fetuses, and infants. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible brain damage and can impair mental functioning. It can retard mental and physical development and reduce attention span.Concord Enterprises imported and sold approximately 430 cases of crayons. They were sold in a plastic box with the following markings on the box: \"12 Jumbo Crayons,\" \"Made in China,\" \"Non-Toxic,\" and \"Distributed by Concord Ent. Los Angeles.\" The crayons are approximately 6 inches long and about half an inch thick. CPSC is investigating other crayons to see if they contain hazardous lead.The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) bans children\\'s products containing hazardous amounts of lead. In addition, the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act amendments to the FHSA require that all art materials be reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and be labeled appropriately. Crayons that contain hazardous lead levels are banned hazardous substances and crayons without the conformance label are misbranded art materials under the law. CPSC\\'s mission is to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission\\'s objective is to reduce the estimated 28.6 million injuries and 21,700 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC\\'s jurisdiction.</p', 'URL': 'https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1994/CPSC-And-Concord-Enterprises-Announce-Recall-Of-Certain-Crayons-Because-Of-Lead-Poisoning-Hazard', 'Title': 'CPSC And Concord Enterprises Announce Recall Of Certain Crayons Because Of Lead Poisoning Hazard', 'ConsumerContact': None, 'LastPublishDate': '2015-02-13T00:00:00', 'Products': [{'Name': 'Concord Enterprise jumbo crayons', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': 'Crayons & Chalk', 'CategoryID': '1901', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}], 'Inconjunctions': [], 'Images': [], 'Injuries': [], 'Manufacturers': [{'Name': 'Concord Enterprises', 'CompanyID': ''}], 'Retailers': [], 'Importers': [], 'Distributors': [], 'SoldAtLabel': None, 'ManufacturerCountries': [{'Country': 'China'}], 'ProductUPCs': [], 'Hazards': [{'Name': 'Lead', 'HazardType': '', 'HazardTypeID': '50'}], 'Remedies': [], 'RemedyOptions': []}, {'RecallID': 5507, 'RecallNumber': '94017', 'RecallDate': '1993-12-13T00:00:00', 'Description': 'DECEMBER 13, 1993 Release # 94-017 PRODUCT: Children\\'s necklaces and bracelets imported and distributed by Midwest Importers of Cannon Falls, Inc.

(Sept. 2) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has culminated a major regulatory proceeding by issuing a final ban on lead-containing paint and on toys and furniture coated with such paint. This action was taken to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings. Until now, the maximum level of lead allowed in consumer paints has been 0.5 percent. CPSC has lowered this amount to 0.06 percent, a level conforming with the maximum permissible under the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. This Act, administered primarily by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, prohibits application of lead-based paint to housing constructed or rehabilitated with federal assistance. Exempted from the new ban are mirrors backed with lead-containing paint which are part of articles of furniture, as well as artists' paints and related materials. Also exempted, provided they bear specified cautionary labeling, are certain agricultural and industrial coatings, touch-up coatings for appliances and lawn and garden equipment, graphic arts coatings, and certain coatings for powered model aircraft.

(Dec. 10) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today warned consumers and religious groups that they may be subjecting themselves needlessly to airborne lead through use of candles containing lead-core wicks. The amount of lead vapor given off by such candles is small and does not, by itself, present an unreasonable health hazard, but the additional lead may present a problem for persons exposed to other sources of lead poisoning, such as older housing with lead-based paint, or in urban neighborhoods with high concentrations of automobile exhaust. The hazards of lead-poisoning are well documented, particularly in infants and young children where brain damage may result. In December 1973, the Health Research Group, a Washington, D.C.,-based public interest group, submitted a petition but at that time, the Commission found that the risk of illness was not sufficient to declare lead-wick candles an imminent hazard and ban them as the petition requested. In view of the known harmful effects of lead ingestion and the growing concern over amounts of lead in the environment from a variety of sources, the continued use of lead-core wicks in candles may be unwise. After the petition, the majority of the industry responded with a commitment to discontinue the use of lead-core wick as soon as a satisfactory substitute could be found and within the year, lead-wick candles were virtually off the market and the sole known producer of lead-core wicking discontinued its production and distribution. The Commission commends this action by the industry. However, it has recently come to the Commission's attention that three firms are producing lead-core wicking and that it is being purchased for use in candles. One firm has decided to cease production and sale of the wicking. Two other firms are continuing to produce lead-core wicking. The remaining two are the Queens Braidworks, Inc., Middle Village, Queens, New York; and the American Wick Company, North Bergen, New Jersey. The primary use for this new wicking appears to be in glass container candles and votive lights used by churches. Votive lights are in some cases burned perpetually and in large numbers. Since candles with lead wicks may continue to be available to consumers, the Commission is considering various options, including a labeling requirement so that all such candles can be identified as containing lead wicks. In the meantime, consumers can easily identify candles with lead-core wicking by a close examination of the candle wick. The lead wire running through the center can be exposed by peeling back the surrounding cotton braid. In view of the ready availability of adequate substitutes for lead wicks in candles, the Commission wishes to remind consumers and candle manufacturers of the needless, potentially harmful effects associated with their continued use.\", 'URL': 'https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1976/CPSC-Warns-Of-Potential-Risk-Associated-With-Certain-Candles-With-Lead-Core-Wicks', 'Title': 'Candles With Lead-Core Wicks Warn', 'ConsumerContact': None, 'LastPublishDate': '2015-02-04T00:00:00', 'Products': [{'Name': 'American Wick Company candles with lead-core candle wicks', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': 'Candles & Candle Holders', 'CategoryID': '1872', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Queens Braidworks candles with lead-core candle wicks', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}], 'Inconjunctions': [], 'Images': [], 'Injuries': [], 'Manufacturers': [{'Name': 'American Wick', 'CompanyID': ''}, {'Name': 'Queens Braidworks', 'CompanyID': ''}], 'Retailers': [], 'Importers': [], 'Distributors': [], 'SoldAtLabel': None, 'ManufacturerCountries': [], 'ProductUPCs': [], 'Hazards': [{'Name': 'Lead', 'HazardType': '', 'HazardTypeID': '50'}], 'Remedies': [], 'RemedyOptions': []}]\n"

PROBLEM: All of these crayons contain lead. The first three (Concord, Toys \\\\\"R\\\\\" Us, and Glory) contain enough lead to present a lead poisoning hazard to young children who might eat or chew on the crayons. While sources such as lead paint are major causes of lead poisoning, it is important to eliminate other contributors to lead poisoning, such as these crayons. The other eight brands do not contain enough lead to increase the blood lead level above the threshold level for lead poisoning, assuming a typical scenario of a child chewing on small pieces of lead- containing crayons over a span of time. However, CPSC is very concerned about these crayons because they add to the overall \\\\\"lead load\\\\\" to children who may eat them. If a child ate an entire lead-containing crayon over the same span of time, the lead poisoning threshold for these crayons would be exceeded. WHAT TO DO: Take the crayons away from children and discard them or, for most of the brands, take them back to the store for a refund. The crayons sold by Bargin Wholesale and by Universal International are being recalled from the importers\\' retail chains. Buy only crayons and other children\\'s art materials that have this label: \\\\\"Conforms to ASTM D-4236\\\\\" (or similar words) which means that a toxicologist has reviewed the formula of the art material for chronic hazards.

Firm will destroy 3,438 boxes of crayons left in inventory. All of these crayons contain lead. The first three (Concord, Toys \\\\\"R\\\\\" Us, and Glory) contain enough lead to present a lead poisoning hazard to young children who might eat or chew on the crayons. The other eight brands do not contain enough lead to increase the blood lead level above the threshold level for lead poisoning (10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and supported by other Federal agencies). This assumes a typical scenario of a child chewing on small pieces of lead-containing crayons over a span of time. However, CPSC is very concerned about these crayons because they add to the overall \\\\\"lead load\\\\\" to children who eat them. If a child ate an entire lead- containing crayon over the same span of time, the lead poisoning threshold for these crayons would be exceeded. The CPSC staff found the lead-containing crayons during a nationwide survey of crayons imported from China. In a separate action, the Arizona Department of Health Services had previously found some crayons imported from China to be a source of high blood lead levels in a Phoenix infant. The Los Angeles-based importer of those crayons, Concord Enterprises, recalled those crayons in cooperation with CPSC on March 22, 1994. Toys \\\\\"R\\\\\" Us conducted tests at an independent lab and did not find hazardous amounts of lead in the crayons they tested. Nevertheless, Toys \\\\\"R\\\\\" Us and CPSC urge consumers to take the Toys \\\\\"R\\\\\" Us crayons away from children and discard them or return them to a Toys \\\\\"R\\\\\" Us store for a refund. Parents should buy only crayons and other children\\'s art materials that have this label: \\\\\"Conforms to ASTM D-4236,\\\\\" or similar words. This label means that the formulas of the crayons and other art materials have been reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and are labeled appropriately. In the case of the crayons imported by Glory Stationery Manufacturing Company Limited, it was inappropriate for the crayons to be labeled \\\\\"Conforms to ASTM D-4236\\\\\" because the crayons contained hazardous levels of lead. CPSC will continue to test art materials to assure that the ASTM label is being properly used. CPSC also will continue to work with the U.S. Customs Service to seize non- ASTM-labeled crayons at ports of entry. Parents should not buy old non-ASTM-labeled art materials still on store shelves. CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said, \\\\\"While there are other causes of lead poisoning, such as lead paint, no children\\'s product, especially crayons, should contain lead. Throw these crayons in the trash or take them back to the store for a refund.\\\\\" Lead has long been recognized asa hazardous substance, especially to young children, infants, and fetuses. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible brain damage and can impair mental functioning. It can retard mental and physical development and reduce attention span. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) bans children\\'s products containing hazardous amounts of lead. In addition, the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA) amendments to the FHSA require that all art materials be reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and be labeled appropriately.

(Sept. 2) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has culminated a major regulatory proceeding by issuing a final ban on lead-containing paint and on toys and furniture coated with such paint. This action was taken to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings. Until now, the maximum level of lead allowed in consumer paints has been 0.5 percent. CPSC has lowered this amount to 0.06 percent, a level conforming with the maximum permissible under the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. This Act, administered primarily by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, prohibits application of lead-based paint to housing constructed or rehabilitated with federal assistance. Exempted from the new ban are mirrors backed with lead-containing paint which are part of articles of furniture, as well as artists\\' paints and related materials. Also exempted, provided they bear specified cautionary labeling, are certain agricultural and industrial coatings, touch-up coatings for appliances and lawn and garden equipment, graphic arts coatings, and certain coatings for powered model aircraft.

(Dec. 10) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today warned consumers and religious groups that they may be subjecting themselves needlessly to airborne lead through use of candles containing lead-core wicks. The amount of lead vapor given off by such candles is small and does not, by itself, present an unreasonable health hazard, but the additional lead may present a problem for persons exposed to other sources of lead poisoning, such as older housing with lead-based paint, or in urban neighborhoods with high concentrations of automobile exhaust. The hazards of lead-poisoning are well documented, particularly in infants and young children where brain damage may result. In December 1973, the Health Research Group, a Washington, D.C.,-based public interest group, submitted a petition but at that time, the Commission found that the risk of illness was not sufficient to declare lead-wick candles an imminent hazard and ban them as the petition requested. In view of the known harmful effects of lead ingestion and the growing concern over amounts of lead in the environment from a variety of sources, the continued use of lead-core wicks in candles may be unwise. After the petition, the majority of the industry responded with a commitment to discontinue the use of lead-core wick as soon as a satisfactory substitute could be found and within the year, lead-wick candles were virtually off the market and the sole known producer of lead-core wicking discontinued its production and distribution. The Commission commends this action by the industry. However, it has recently come to the Commission\\'s attention that three firms are producing lead-core wicking and that it is being purchased for use in candles. One firm has decided to cease production and sale of the wicking. Two other firms are continuing to produce lead-core wicking. The remaining two are the Queens Braidworks, Inc., Middle Village, Queens, New York; and the American Wick Company, North Bergen, New Jersey. The primary use for this new wicking appears to be in glass container candles and votive lights used by churches. Votive lights are in some cases burned perpetually and in large numbers. Since candles with lead wicks may continue to be available to consumers, the Commission is considering various options, including a labeling requirement so that all such candles can be identified as containing lead wicks. In the meantime, consumers can easily identify candles with lead-core wicking by a close examination of the candle wick. The lead wire running through the center can be exposed by peeling back the surrounding cotton braid. In view of the ready availability of adequate substitutes for lead wicks in candles, the Commission wishes to remind consumers and candle manufacturers of the needless, potentially harmful effects associated with their continued use.\", \"URL\": \"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1976/CPSC-Warns-Of-Potential-Risk-Associated-With-Certain-Candles-With-Lead-Core-Wicks\", \"Title\": \"Candles With Lead-Core Wicks Warn\", \"ConsumerContact\": null, \"LastPublishDate\": \"2015-02-04T00:00:00\", \"Products\": [{\"Name\": \"American Wick Company candles with lead-core candle wicks\", \"Description\": \"\", \"Model\": \"\", \"Type\": \"Candles & Candle Holders\", \"CategoryID\": \"1872\", \"NumberOfUnits\": \"\"}, {\"Name\": \"Queens Braidworks candles with lead-core candle wicks\", \"Description\": \"\", \"Model\": \"\", \"Type\": \"\", \"CategoryID\": \"\", \"NumberOfUnits\": \"\"}], \"Inconjunctions\": [], \"Images\": [], \"Injuries\": [], \"Manufacturers\": [{\"Name\": \"American Wick\", \"CompanyID\": \"\"}, {\"Name\": \"Queens Braidworks\", \"CompanyID\": \"\"}], \"Retailers\": [], \"Importers\": [], \"Distributors\": [], \"SoldAtLabel\": null, \"ManufacturerCountries\": [], \"ProductUPCs\": [], \"Hazards\": [{\"Name\": \"Lead\", \"HazardType\": \"\", \"HazardTypeID\": \"50\"}], \"Remedies\": [], \"RemedyOptions\": []}]'"

PROBLEM: All of these crayons contain lead. The first three (Concord, Toys \\\"R\\\" Us, and Glory) contain enough lead to present a lead poisoning hazard to young children who might eat or chew on the crayons. While sources such as lead paint are major causes of lead poisoning, it is important to eliminate other contributors to lead poisoning, such as these crayons. The other eight brands do not contain enough lead to increase the blood lead level above the threshold level for lead poisoning, assuming a typical scenario of a child chewing on small pieces of lead- containing crayons over a span of time. However, CPSC is very concerned about these crayons because they add to the overall \\\"lead load\\\" to children who may eat them. If a child ate an entire lead-containing crayon over the same span of time, the lead poisoning threshold for these crayons would be exceeded. WHAT TO DO: Take the crayons away from children and discard them or, for most of the brands, take them back to the store for a refund. The crayons sold by Bargin Wholesale and by Universal International are being recalled from the importers' retail chains. Buy only crayons and other children's art materials that have this label: \\\"Conforms to ASTM D-4236\\\" (or similar words) which means that a toxicologist has reviewed the formula of the art material for chronic hazards. WASHINGTON, DC -- CPSC announces recalls of several imported crayons because of a lead poisoning hazard. Importers of the following Chinese crayons are taking these corrective actions: - \\\"12 Jumbo Crayons,\\\" Concord Enterprises, Los Angeles, CA. Sold approximately 430 cases in 18 States. Return to store for refund. - \\\"Safe 48 Non-Toxic I'm a Toys \\\"R\\\" Us Kid! Crayons,\\\" Toys \\\"R\\\" Us, Paramus, NJ. Sold 100,000 packages in 1990-91 and 2,000 packages in last year. The crayons were packaged in plastic cylindrical containers with a crayon sharpener in the lid and a paper label featuring Geoffrey the Giraffe and reading in part: \\\"SAFE 48 NON- TOXIC I\\\"M A TOYS \\\"R\\\" US KID! CRAYONS *** manufactured by BSA Assoc., N.Y., N.Y. 10010 for Geoffrey Inc. *** Made in China.\\\" Individual crayons bear a paper label reading in part \\\"RAINBOW CRAYONS *** BSA *** Made in China.\\\" Return to store for refund. - \\\"12 Crayons, Glory\\\" and \\\"18 Crayons That Paint, Conforms ASTM D- 4236,\\\" Glory Stationery Manufacturing Company Limited, Los Angeles, CA. According to the importer, none of the crayons was sold at retail level. Those crayons shipped to distributors have been recalled, and all crayons at the importer's warehouse will be destroyed. - \\\"64 Crayons, School Quality, No. 8064,\\\" A.J. Cohen Distributors, Hauppauge, NY. Sold 226,008 units in Eastern United States. Return to store for refund. - \\\"64 Crayons, #CR 64-64 CT,\\\" Baum Imports, New York, NY. Sold 80,400 boxes in metropolitan New York City area. Return to store for refund. - \\\"12 Super Jumbo Crayons,\\\" Dynamic Division of Agora International, St. Albans, NY. Sold 36,000 boxes nationwide. Return to store for refund. - \\\"8 Crayons, No 5 CL 850,\\\" Dynamic Division of Agora International, St. Albans, NY. Sold 120,000 boxes nationwide. Return to store for refund. - \\\"Fun Time 72 Crayons, No. B541,\\\" Overseas United, New York, NY. Sold 16,949 boxes in metropolitan New York City area. Return to store for refund. - \\\"64 Crayons, Kidz Biz,\\\" Bargin Wholesale, Los Angeles, CA. Sold 101,184 boxes nationwide. Firm will recall from \\\"The $.99 Store\\\" chain. - \\\"64 Crayons, SKU#51-02600,\\\" Universal International, Minneapolis, MN. Firm imported 295,000 boxes. Firm will recall from the \\\"Only Deals\\\" chain. - \\\"Feido, 12 Crayons, No. CC8812,\\\" Kipp Brothers Inc., Indianapolis, IN. Sold 19,006 nationwide. Firm will destroy 3,438 boxes of crayons left in inventory. All of these crayons contain lead. The first three (Concord, Toys \\\"R\\\" Us, and Glory) contain enough lead to present a lead poisoning hazard to young children who might eat or chew on the crayons. The other eight brands do not contain enough lead to increase the blood lead level above the threshold level for lead poisoning (10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and supported by other Federal agencies). This assumes a typical scenario of a child chewing on small pieces of lead-containing crayons over a span of time. However, CPSC is very concerned about these crayons because they add to the overall \\\"lead load\\\" to children who eat them. If a child ate an entire lead- containing crayon over the same span of time, the lead poisoning threshold for these crayons would be exceeded. The CPSC staff found the lead-containing crayons during a nationwide survey of crayons imported from China. In a separate action, the Arizona Department of Health Services had previously found some crayons imported from China to be a source of high blood lead levels in a Phoenix infant. The Los Angeles-based importer of those crayons, Concord Enterprises, recalled those crayons in cooperation with CPSC on March 22, 1994. Toys \\\"R\\\" Us conducted tests at an independent lab and did not find hazardous amounts of lead in the crayons they tested. Nevertheless, Toys \\\"R\\\" Us and CPSC urge consumers to take the Toys \\\"R\\\" Us crayons away from children and discard them or return them to a Toys \\\"R\\\" Us store for a refund. Parents should buy only crayons and other children's art materials that have this label: \\\"Conforms to ASTM D-4236,\\\" or similar words. This label means that the formulas of the crayons and other art materials have been reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and are labeled appropriately. In the case of the crayons imported by Glory Stationery Manufacturing Company Limited, it was inappropriate for the crayons to be labeled \\\"Conforms to ASTM D-4236\\\" because the crayons contained hazardous levels of lead. CPSC will continue to test art materials to assure that the ASTM label is being properly used. CPSC also will continue to work with the U.S. Customs Service to seize non- ASTM-labeled crayons at ports of entry. Parents should not buy old non-ASTM-labeled art materials still on store shelves. CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said, \\\"While there are other causes of lead poisoning, such as lead paint, no children's product, especially crayons, should contain lead. Throw these crayons in the trash or take them back to the store for a refund.\\\" Lead has long been recognized asa hazardous substance, especially to young children, infants, and fetuses. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible brain damage and can impair mental functioning. It can retard mental and physical development and reduce attention span. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) bans children's products containing hazardous amounts of lead. In addition, the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA) amendments to the FHSA require that all art materials be reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and be labeled appropriately. Crayons that contain hazardous lead levels are banned hazardous substances and crayons without the conformance label are misbranded art materials under the law. CPSC's mission is to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to reduce the estimated 28.6 million injuries and 21,700 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction\",\n",

While other sources such as lead paint are major causes of lead poisoning, it is important to eliminate other contributors to lead poisoning, such as these crayons. WHAT TO DO: Take the yellow and orange crayons away from children and discard them or take them back to the store for a refund. Buy only crayons and other children's art materials that have this label: \\\"Conforms to ASTM D-4236\\\" (or similar words) which means that a toxicologist has reviewed the art material for chronic hazards. Retailers should stop sale and return crayons to Concord Enterprises. WASHINGTON, DC -- CPSC and Concord Enterprises announces the recall of certain crayons imported from China because of a lead poisoning hazard. CPSC tested the crayons and found hazardous amounts of lead in the yellow and orange color crayons. If a child eats or chews on the crayon, lead poisoning could occur. Therefore, CPSC urges consumers to take the crayons away from children and discard them or return them to the store for a refund. Retailers should stop sale and return the crayons to Concord Enterprises. Parents should buy only crayons and other children's art materials that have this label: \\\"Conforms to ASTM D-4236,\\\" or similar words. This label means that the crayons and other art materials have been reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and are labeled appropriately. No art materials lacking the conformance label or bearing hazard labeling should be given to young children.CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said, \\\"While there are other major causes of lead poisoning, such as lead paint, we want to eliminate any additional lead sources, such as crayons. Throw these crayons in the trash can or take them back to the store for a refund.\\\" Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous substance, especially to young children, fetuses, and infants. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible brain damage and can impair mental functioning. It can retard mental and physical development and reduce attention span.Concord Enterprises imported and sold approximately 430 cases of crayons. They were sold in a plastic box with the following markings on the box: \\\"12 Jumbo Crayons,\\\" \\\"Made in China,\\\" \\\"Non-Toxic,\\\" and \\\"Distributed by Concord Ent. Los Angeles.\\\" The crayons are approximately 6 inches long and about half an inch thick. CPSC is investigating other crayons to see if they contain hazardous lead.The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) bans children's products containing hazardous amounts of lead. In addition, the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act amendments to the FHSA require that all art materials be reviewed by a toxicologist for chronic hazards and be labeled appropriately. Crayons that contain hazardous lead levels are banned hazardous substances and crayons without the conformance label are misbranded art materials under the law. CPSC's mission is to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to reduce the estimated 28.6 million injuries and 21,700 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction.</p\",\n",

PROBLEM: Lead in the red stripes on the candy cane roller exceeds federal government standards presenting a safety hazard for young children. WHAT TO DO: Return to the store where purchased for a product exchange or full refund. For more information, consumers may call the Little Tikes Company at 1-800-321-0183 or 330-656-3906. WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Little Tikes Company of Hudson, OH, is voluntarily recalling 16,300 Little Tikes Crib Centers, model number 1525. Testing the crib center in accordance with regulations under the Consumer Product Safety Act revealed a level of lead in the red stripes on the candy cane roller which exceeds government standards and presents a safety hazard for young children. Neither CPSC nor the company is aware of any injuries involving these products. This voluntary recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury. The Little Tikes Crib Center is an infant crib toy that measures 18-1/2 inches long, 3-3/4 inches wide and 14-1/2 inches high. It is intended to be mounted on an inside crib rail. The crib center has nine large bright features including the red and white cylindrical candy cane roller. The roller is 4-1/4 inches long and three inches in diameter. The label on the carton in which the crib center was sold reads in part: \\\" . . . CRIB CENTER, LITTLE TIKES, MADE IN USA.\\\" The model number, 1525, is molded on the back of the product, next to Little Tikes' toll- free 800 telephone number. A new purple and white-striped candy cane roller that meets all safety standards has been substituted for the unsafe roller. The revised crib center with purple stripes has a fluorescent orange dot on the package and is not being recalled. The revised product has been sold in retail stores since mid-February 1992. The Little Tikes Crib Center was sold nationwide at a variety of retail stores from November 1991 through January 1992. The Crib Center sold for an estimated price of $20.00 each. Consumers are urged to dismantle the recalled Little Tikes Crib Centers from crib rails immediately and return them to the store where purchased for a product exchange or full refund. For more information, consumers may contact the Little Tikes Company at 1-800-321-0183 or 330-656-3906. The potentially hazardous toys were reported by the Little Tikes Company under section 15 of the Consumer Product Safety Act. CPSC is announcing this recall as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The Commission's objective is to reduce the estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths associated each year with the 15,000 different types of consumer products under CPSC's jurisdiction.

(Sept. 2) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has culminated a major regulatory proceeding by issuing a final ban on lead-containing paint and on toys and furniture coated with such paint. This action was taken to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings. Until now, the maximum level of lead allowed in consumer paints has been 0.5 percent. CPSC has lowered this amount to 0.06 percent, a level conforming with the maximum permissible under the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. This Act, administered primarily by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, prohibits application of lead-based paint to housing constructed or rehabilitated with federal assistance. Exempted from the new ban are mirrors backed with lead-containing paint which are part of articles of furniture, as well as artists' paints and related materials. Also exempted, provided they bear specified cautionary labeling, are certain agricultural and industrial coatings, touch-up coatings for appliances and lawn and garden equipment, graphic arts coatings, and certain coatings for powered model aircraft. This ban under the Consumer Product Safety Act will take effect 180 days after publication September 1 in the Federal Register and will apply to products manufactured on and after that date\",\n",

      "        \"Description\": \"Candles With Lead-Core Wicks Warn NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 10, 1976 Release # 76-086 CPSC Warns Of Potential Risk Associated With Certain Candles With Lead-Core Wicks WASHINGTON, D.C. (Dec. 10) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today warned consumers and religious groups that they may be subjecting themselves needlessly to airborne lead through use of candles containing lead-core wicks. The amount of lead vapor given off by such candles is small and does not, by itself, present an unreasonable health hazard, but the additional lead may present a problem for persons exposed to other sources of lead poisoning, such as older housing with lead-based paint, or in urban neighborhoods with high concentrations of automobile exhaust. The hazards of lead-poisoning are well documented, particularly in infants and young children where brain damage may result. In December 1973, the Health Research Group, a Washington, D.C.,-based public interest group, submitted a petition but at that time, the Commission found that the risk of illness was not sufficient to declare lead-wick candles an imminent hazard and ban them as the petition requested. In view of the known harmful effects of lead ingestion and the growing concern over amounts of lead in the environment from a variety of sources, the continued use of lead-core wicks in candles may be unwise. After the petition, the majority of the industry responded with a commitment to discontinue the use of lead-core wick as soon as a satisfactory substitute could be found and within the year, lead-wick candles were virtually off the market and the sole known producer of lead-core wicking discontinued its production and distribution. The Commission commends this action by the industry. However, it has recently come to the Commission's attention that three firms are producing lead-core wicking and that it is being purchased for use in candles. One firm has decided to cease production and sale of the wicking. Two other firms are continuing to produce lead-core wicking. The remaining two are the Queens Braidworks, Inc., Middle Village, Queens, New York; and the American Wick Company, North Bergen, New Jersey. The primary use for this new wicking appears to be in glass container candles and votive lights used by churches. Votive lights are in some cases burned perpetually and in large numbers. Since candles with lead wicks may continue to be available to consumers, the Commission is considering various options, including a labeling requirement so that all such candles can be identified as containing lead wicks. In the meantime, consumers can easily identify candles with lead-core wicking by a close examination of the candle wick. The lead wire running through the center can be exposed by peeling back the surrounding cotton braid. In view of the ready availability of adequate substitutes for lead wicks in candles, the Commission wishes to remind consumers and candle manufacturers of the needless, potentially harmful effects associated with their continued use.\",\n",
